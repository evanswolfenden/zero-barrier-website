    <p>Currently, making any object out of metal is extremely expensive. Manufacturing through a factory could cost thousands if not millions of dollars. This is a significant barrier for small businesses that prevent new products from entering the market.</p>
    <p>To solve this problem, we are establishing a metal 3D printing factory. Once we launch, our customers will upload 3D models of their parts to this website, our 3D printers will create them, and within a few days they will be delivered. Our competitive advantage rests in the new type of metal 3D printer that we are developing. It is 60x faster and 17x cheaper than existing technologies.</p>
